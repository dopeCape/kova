# Kova Ideology
Vision

To democratize modern deployment management by delivering the simplicity and elegance of cloud platforms like Vercel—without the lock-in, cost, or loss of control.

We believe developers should spend their time creating, not fighting their deployment infrastructure.
# Core Beliefs

1. Simplicity Without Sacrifice

Deployment should be seamless and intuitive—without sacrificing power or flexibility. Kova aims to deliver a first-class developer experience while enabling teams to fully customize and own their infrastructure.

2. Open Source as a Foundation

We believe infrastructure tooling should be transparent, extensible, and community-driven. By being open-source, Kova invites collaboration, auditability, and continuous improvement—avoiding the black boxes of proprietary systems.

3. Freedom from Vendor Lock-In

Organizations should not have to trade convenience for lock-in. Kova ensures teams can deploy anywhere—on-premises, cloud, or hybrid—retaining full control over costs, data, and architecture decisions.

4. Empowerment Through Control

We recognize that teams vary in needs. Kova gives them the power to define their own deployment workflows, scale on their own terms, and integrate with the tools they already use.

5. Cost-Effectiveness for All

Infrastructure is expensive enough without paying premiums for convenience. Kova enables organizations of any size to access modern deployment workflows without prohibitive pricing.
